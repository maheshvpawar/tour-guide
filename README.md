# Tour Guide
Tour Guide app illustrating project done as a part of Udacity's Android Basics: Multiscreen Apps course

## Description
This app helps you in exploring Mumbai city.

## What will I learn?
This project is about combining various ideas and skills Iâ€™ve been practicing throughout the course. They include:
- Planning the app design and navigation before coding.
- Selecting proper data structures to store lists of information.
- Building layouts to display those lists of data.
- Navigating between those lists using intents and multiple Activities or a ViewPager.
- Creating our own custom classes.
- Properly handling images or audio (if applicable).
